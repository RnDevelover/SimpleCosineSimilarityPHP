# Simple cosine similarity implementation in PHP

Cosine similarity is a widely used similarity measure of two texts.
This simple code computes cosine similarity of two text files given as parameters.
To use this, php-cli (PHP command line interpreter) must be working.
The output is written to the STDOUT.
I have made the cosine similarity code work in PHP. 
I have not implemented all of the code. 
The code is developed using the ideas and piece of codes in various web sites.

Usage:

php computeCosine.php file1 file2
